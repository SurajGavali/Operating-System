LAB-2 : Conformance test

Done to check whether a software conforms to expected behaviour.

conformance testing of the system calls that is done by calling the different system call functions (e.g. write(), read(), open(), etc.) and checking if they do the desired job.
Conformance testing of an OS:

OS provides "system calls" to an applications. E.g. printf(), scanf(), etc. results in an System call.
For example:

1. By executing "int 0x80" instructions, 2. By specifying different arguments in register(e.g. EAX) the "int 0x80" may jump to different locations. Each of these then acts as a different System call.
OS system calls are normally made available to programmers using c-library.

programmers normally don't write "int 0x80" like instructions. programmers normally call functions like printf(), scanf().

The printf() is actually a wrapper function on top of the write() funtion call, write() function call is actually the synonym in C of operating system's "write" system call.
